How-to Instructions:
The cable seated row is a popular exercise targeting the muscles of the upper and middle back. Here's a step-by-step guide to performing the cable seated row correctly:



Set Up the Machine:



Attach the desired handle to the cable row machine. Adjust the seat and chest pad (if available) so that you can reach the handle comfortably without overextending.



Starting Position:



Sit down on the machine with your feet securely placed on the footrests. Your knees should be slightly bent.

Grasp the handle with both hands, using an overhand or neutral grip (palms facing each other). Sit with a straight back and slight lean forward from the hips, keeping your chest up and core engaged.



Executing the Row:



Pull the handle towards your torso, leading with your elbows. Your elbows should stay close to your body. As you pull, squeeze your shoulder blades together and keep your back straight. Avoid using your lower back to pull; focus on using your upper and middle back muscles.



End Position:



Pull the handle until it reaches your torso, typically around the lower chest or upper abdomen.

Hold this position for a brief moment to maximize the contraction in your back muscles.



Return to Starting Position:



Slowly extend your arms and return the handle to the starting position, maintaining control of the weight throughout the movement. Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders as you return to the start.

Barbell

Exercise Types:
Beginner - Strength - Compound

Equipment:
Barbell

How-to Instructions:
The barbell squat is a fundamental exercise for building lower body strength, targeting the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and core. Here’s how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Load the barbell with the desired weight and position it on a squat rack at about shoulder height. Stand under the barbell with your feet shoulder-width apart.



Positioning the Barbell:



Position the barbell across your upper back (trapezius muscles), not your neck. You can use a high-bar position (resting on your traps) or a low-bar position (resting across the rear deltoids, just below the traps). Grip the barbell with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lift your elbows slightly to create a stable shelf with your upper back muscles for the bar to rest on.



Unracking the Barbell:



Stand up to lift the barbell off the rack, taking a step or two back to clear the rack. Ensure your feet are shoulder-width apart with toes slightly pointed out.



Starting Position:



Keep your chest up, back straight, and core engaged. Look forward or slightly up, maintaining a neutral head position. Ensure your weight is evenly distributed across your feet.



Descending into the Squat:



Inhale deeply to brace your core. Push your hips back and bend your knees to lower your body into the squat.

Keep your chest up and your back straight throughout the movement. Lower yourself until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground. If you have the flexibility, you can go lower, but avoid rounding your lower back.



Ascending from the Squat:



Exhale and push through your heels to stand back up. Extend your knees and hips simultaneously, keeping your chest up and back straight. Fully extend your legs at the top of the movement but avoid locking out your knees.

How-to Instructions:
Performing a bodyweight dip is an excellent way to build strength in the triceps, chest, and shoulders. Here’s how to do it correctly:



Set Up:



Position yourself between the parallel bars and grip them firmly with your hands, thumbs wrapped around the bars. Jump or step up so your arms are fully extended and supporting your body weight. Keep your arms straight and your legs crossed at the ankles if desired for stability.



Starting Position:



Maintain an upright posture with your chest up and shoulders back. Engage your core to keep your body stable.



Executing the Dip:



Lower your body by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your body. Lean slightly forward to engage your chest muscles more, or stay more upright to focus on your triceps. Continue lowering until your upper arms are parallel to the ground or your shoulders are just below your elbows.



End Position:



At the bottom of the movement, your elbows should be at about a 90-degree angle, and you should feel a stretch in your chest and triceps.



Return to Starting Position:



Push yourself back up by straightening your arms, bringing your body back to the starting position. Avoid locking your elbows at the top to keep tension on the muscles.

How-to Instructions:
The push-up is a fundamental bodyweight exercise that primarily targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps, while also engaging the core and other stabilizing muscles. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform a standard push-up:



Starting Position:



Hand Placement: Place your hands on the ground, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.



Body Alignment: Extend your legs straight behind you, with your feet together or slightly apart. Your body should form a straight line from your head to your heels.



Engage Your Core: Tighten your core muscles to keep your body straight and avoid sagging in the lower back.



Lowering Phase:



Inhale as you bend your elbows and lower your body toward the ground. Keep your elbows at about a 45-degree angle to your body. Lower yourself until your chest nearly touches the ground, while maintaining a straight body line.



Pushing Phase:



Exhale as you push through your palms to straighten your arms and lift your body back to the starting position.

Keep your core engaged and your body in a straight line throughout the movement.

How-to Instructions:
The Dumbbell Shoulder Shrug is an excellent exercise for targeting the upper trapezius muscles. Here's how to perform it correctly:



Starting Position:



Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your arms fully extended by your sides, palms facing your body (neutral grip). Keep your back straight, chest up, and head facing forward. Your shoulders should be relaxed.



Engage Your Core:



Tighten your abdominal muscles to maintain stability and support your lower back throughout the exercise.



Shrug Your Shoulders:



Lift your shoulders straight up towards your ears as high as you can. Imagine trying to touch your shoulders to your ears. Avoid rolling your shoulders backward or forward; the movement should be straight up and down.

Keep your arms straight, allowing the dumbbells to rise naturally as your shoulders lift.



Pause:



Briefly pause at the top of the movement, squeezing your trapezius muscles.



Lower Your Shoulders:



Slowly lower your shoulders back to the starting position in a controlled manner.

How-to Instructions:
The cable cross-over is an excellent exercise for targeting the chest muscles, particularly the pectoralis major. It also engages the shoulders and triceps. Here’s how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Set the pulleys to the highest position on the cable crossover machine. Attach handles to the cables. Select an appropriate weight for each side.



Starting Position:



Stand in the center of the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart. Grab the handles with an overhand grip (palms facing down) and take a step forward into a staggered stance (one foot slightly in front of the other) for better balance. Your arms should be extended out to your sides with a slight bend in your elbows. Your elbows should remain in this slightly bent position throughout the movement.



Executing the Cross-Over:



Inhale and engage your core. Pull the handles down and across your body in a wide arc, bringing your hands together in front of you at around chest level or slightly lower. Your arms should move in a controlled manner, mimicking a hugging motion. Focus on squeezing your chest muscles as your hands meet in front of your body. You can cross your hands over each other for a greater contraction.



Returning to Starting Position:



Exhale and slowly reverse the motion, allowing your arms to move back to the starting position in a controlled manner. Maintain the slight bend in your elbows and control the resistance on the way back to prevent the weights from pulling your arms too far back.

A Machine Ab Crunch, often referred to as a "Crunch Machine" exercise, is a popular way to target the abdominal muscles. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to perform this exercise correctly:



Set Up



Adjust the Seat and Back Pad: 



Ensure the seat height is adjusted so that your knees are at a 90-degree angle when seated. The back pad should support your back comfortably. Your upper back should be against the pad.



Select the Weight: 



Choose an appropriate weight for your fitness level. Start with a lighter weight if you are new to this exercise and increase it as you become more comfortable.



Sit Down: 



Sit on the machine with your back pressed firmly against the back pad. Place your feet under the foot pads (if available) or flat on the floor, depending on the machine design. Grab the handles above your shoulders or next to your head, depending on the machine’s design.



Engage Your Core: 



Tighten your abdominal muscles before starting the movement. Slowly contract your abs to curl your torso forward. Your upper body should move towards your knees.



Breathing: 



Exhale as you crunch forward.



Range of Motion: 



Aim to move through a full range of motion, but avoid using momentum or swinging your body.



Hold the Contraction: 



Pause briefly at the peak of the movement to maximize the contraction in your abs. Slowly release the contraction and return to the starting position. Inhale as you return to the starting position.

How-to Instructions:
The standing cable lateral raise is a great exercise for building strong shoulders and targeting the middle deltoids. Using a cable machine offers consistent resistance, making this exercise effective for muscle development. Here’s how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Attach a single handle to the low pulley of a cable machine. Select an appropriate weight.



Starting Position:



Stand with your side facing the cable machine. Grab the handle with the hand of your arm furthest from the machine, so the cable runs across the front of your body. Bend your knees slightly to get into a bent-over position, keeping your back straight and hinging at your hips. Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor.

Keep your free hand on your knee or a stable surface for support.



Executing the Lateral Raise:



Inhale and brace your core. With a slight bend in your elbow, raise your arm across your body and out to the side until it is level with the ground. Your palm should face downward or slightly backward at the top of the movement. Focus on lifting with your shoulder and not using your back or arms to swing the weight.



Holding the Position:



Hold the raised position for a brief count to maximize the contraction in your rear deltoids.



Returning to Starting Position:



Exhale and slowly lower your arm back to the starting position in a controlled manner, maintaining tension on the muscle throughout the movement.



Switching Sides:



Complete the desired number of repetitions for one side, then switch sides and repeat the exercise with the other arm.

How-to Instructions:
The barbell shoulder press is an effective exercise for building shoulder strength and mass, targeting the deltoid muscles, triceps, and upper chest. Here's how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Load the barbell with the desired weight. If using a squat rack or power rack, set the barbell at about chest height.



Starting Position:



Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Approach the barbell and grip it with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using an overhand grip (palms facing forward). Unrack the barbell by pushing up with your legs and stepping back from the rack. Alternatively, if lifting from the floor, clean the barbell to shoulder height.

Hold the barbell at shoulder height with your elbows slightly in front of the bar, not flared out to the sides.



Pressing the Barbell:



Inhale and brace your core, keeping a slight bend in your knees for stability. Press the barbell upward in a straight line until your arms are fully extended above your head. Ensure your head moves slightly back to allow the bar to pass, then bring your head back to neutral as the barbell reaches the top. Keep your wrists straight and aligned with your forearms.



Lowering the Barbell:



Exhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position at shoulder height. Control the movement and avoid letting the barbell drop too quickly.

How-to Instructions:
The barbell upright row is a great exercise for targeting the shoulders, specifically the deltoids and traps. Here’s how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Load the barbell with the desired weight. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and the barbell on the floor in front of you.



Starting Position:



Bend at your hips and knees to grip the barbell with an overhand (pronated) grip, your hands slightly closer than shoulder-width apart. Lift the barbell to a standing position with your arms extended, keeping it close to your body. Your back should be straight, core engaged, and shoulders back.



Executing the Row:



Inhale and brace your core. Lift the barbell by driving your elbows up and to the sides, keeping the bar close to your body. Continue to lift until the barbell reaches your upper chest or just below your chin. Your elbows should be higher than your wrists at the top of the movement. Focus on lifting with your shoulders and traps rather than using your arms.



Lowering the Barbell:



Exhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position with a controlled motion. Keep your core engaged and maintain good posture throughout the movement.

How-to Instructions:
The Hanging Leg Raise is a core exercise that targets the abdominal muscles, particularly the lower abs, and also engages the hip flexors, grip, and shoulders. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to perform the exercise correctly:



Starting Position:



Find a pull-up bar or a secure overhead bar that can support your weight. Grip the bar with an overhand (pronated) grip, hands shoulder-width apart. Let your body hang freely with your arms fully extended and legs straight. Keep your core engaged to avoid swinging.



Execution:



Tighten your core muscles before you start the movement. Keeping your legs straight, lift them up towards your torso. Aim to bring your feet as high as possible, ideally reaching the level of the bar or higher if your flexibility allows. Exhale as you lift your legs up.



Top Position:



Pause briefly at the top of the movement, ensuring that your core is fully engaged and your legs are controlled.

Your body should form an L-shape if you can lift your legs to a 90-degree angle with your torso.



Lowering Phase:



Slowly lower your legs back to the starting position in a controlled manner. Avoid swinging or using momentum.

Inhale as you lower your legs.

How-to Instructions:
The close-grip barbell bench press is an excellent exercise for targeting the triceps, as well as the chest and shoulders. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Load the barbell with an appropriate amount of weight for your fitness level. Use safety clips to secure the weights. Lie down on the flat bench with your feet flat on the ground and your head, shoulders, and buttocks firmly pressed against the bench.



Hand Placement:



Grip the barbell with your hands closer than shoulder-width apart, around 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) apart. Ensure your thumbs are wrapped around the bar for safety.



Starting Position:



Unrack the barbell by straightening your arms and moving the barbell over your chest. Your arms should be perpendicular to the floor. Keep your wrists straight and directly over your elbows to maintain proper alignment and reduce strain.



Lowering the Barbell:



Inhale deeply and lower the barbell slowly and under control to your lower chest or upper abdomen. Your elbows should stay close to your body, not flaring out. Lower the bar until it lightly touches your chest or is just above it. Do not bounce the bar off your chest.



Pressing the Barbell:



Exhale and press the barbell back up to the starting position by fully extending your arms. Focus on engaging your triceps during the lift. Keep your elbows close to your body throughout the movement to maximize tricep activation.

Equipment:
Barbell

How-to Instructions:
The T-Bar Row is an effective exercise for targeting the muscles of the upper back, particularly the lats, rhomboids, and traps. Here's a detailed guide on how to perform it correctly:



Set Up the Equipment:



Load the appropriate amount of weight onto one end of the barbell. Secure the other end of the barbell in a landmine attachment or corner of the gym for stability if not using a T-Bar Row machine. Attach the T-Bar Row handle under the weighted end of the barbell.



Position Yourself:



Stand over the barbell with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees slightly and hinge at the hips, keeping your back straight and your chest up. Reach down and grasp the handles with both hands, using an overhand grip (palms facing each other if using a V-handle).



Starting Position:



Pull your shoulders back and engage your core to maintain a neutral spine. Let your arms fully extend down, holding the handle. The barbell should be hanging between your legs.



Execution:



Keeping your elbows close to your body, pull the handle towards your torso. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement. Lift the barbell until the handle touches or comes close to your lower chest/upper abdomen.



Lowering the Bar:



Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position in a controlled manner, fully extending your arms. Maintain tension in your back muscles throughout the movement.

Equipment:

How-to Instructions:
The Dumbbell One-Arm Front Raise is an effective exercise for targeting the anterior deltoid, which is the front part of the shoulder. Here’s a step-by-step guide to performing the exercise correctly:



Set Up:



Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in one hand. Let your arm hang down in front of your body, palm facing toward your thigh.



Starting Position:



Maintain a straight back and engage your core for stability. Your shoulders should be relaxed, and your chest should be up.



Executing the Raise:



Keeping your arm straight, slowly lift the dumbbell directly in front of you until it is at shoulder height. Focus on using your shoulder muscles to lift the weight, rather than swinging the arm. Keep your wrist in a neutral position, neither flexing nor extending.



End Position:



At the top of the movement, your arm should be parallel to the floor, and the dumbbell should be at shoulder height. Pause briefly to feel the contraction in your anterior deltoid.



Return to Starting Position:



Lower the dumbbell back down in a controlled manner, returning to the starting position with your arm hanging straight down. Avoid letting the weight drop; maintain control throughout the descent.

Lie down on the decline bench with your feet securely hooked under the foot pads to prevent sliding. Position yourself so that your eyes are directly under the barbell.



Hand Placement:



Grip the barbell with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Your palms should face forward, and your thumbs should wrap around the bar.



Unracking the Barbell:



With the help of a spotter if available, unrack the barbell by straightening your arms and moving the barbell over your lower chest. Your arms should be perpendicular to the floor.



Lowering the Barbell:



Inhale deeply and lower the barbell slowly and under control to your lower chest. Your elbows should be at about a 45-degree angle to your body. Lower the bar until it lightly touches your lower chest. Do not bounce the bar off your chest.



Pressing the Barbell:



Exhale and press the barbell back up to the starting position by fully extending your arms. Focus on squeezing your chest muscles during the lift. Keep your wrists straight and your elbows slightly tucked in to protect your shoulder joints.

How-to Instructions:
The barbell tricep extension, also known as the lying tricep extension or skull crusher when done in a supine position, is a great exercise for targeting the triceps. Here's how you can perform it:



Preparation:



Lie down on a flat bench with your back pressed against it. Your feet should be flat on the floor for stability.

Hold a barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing away from you), slightly narrower than shoulder-width apart. Your arms should be fully extended towards the ceiling, perpendicular to the floor.



Execution:



Lower the barbell towards your forehead by bending your elbows. Keep your upper arms stationary throughout the movement. Lower the barbell until your forearms are parallel to the floor or until you feel a good stretch in your triceps. Your elbows should be pointing towards the ceiling. Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement, then extend your elbows to raise the barbell back to the starting position. Keep your wrists firm and stable throughout the exercise.

How-to Instructions:
The cable upright row is an excellent exercise for targeting the shoulders and upper traps. Here's a step-by-step guide to performing the cable upright row correctly:



Set Up the Machine:



Attach the straight bar or rope attachment to the low pulley of the cable machine. Adjust the weight to a suitable level.



Starting Position:



Stand facing the cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart. Grasp the bar with an overhand grip (palms facing your body), hands about shoulder-width apart. Stand straight with your chest up, shoulders back, and core engaged.



Executing the Row:



Pull the bar straight up towards your chin, leading with your elbows. Your elbows should flare out to the sides.

Keep the bar close to your body as you lift.



End Position:



Lift the bar until your elbows are at or just above shoulder height. Your hands should be approximately at chest level. Hold the top position for a brief moment to maximize the contraction in your shoulder and upper trap muscles.



Return to Starting Position:



Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position, maintaining control of the weight throughout the movement.

Equipment:

How-to Instructions:
The Dumbbell Upright Row is an effective exercise for targeting the shoulders, particularly the deltoids, as well as the trapezius muscles. Here’s how to perform it correctly:



Starting Position:



Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip (palms facing your body). Let the dumbbells hang down at arm’s length in front of your thighs. Your arms should be fully extended, and your elbows slightly bent.



Engage Your Core:



Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your torso throughout the exercise.



Lift the Dumbbells:



Begin by lifting your elbows up and out to the sides. Lead with your elbows as you raise the dumbbells. Keep the dumbbells close to your body as you lift them upwards. Continue lifting until the dumbbells reach about chest level or just below your chin. Your elbows should be higher than your wrists at the top of the movement.



Pause:



Briefly pause at the top of the movement, focusing on squeezing your shoulder and upper back muscles.



Lower the Dumbbells:



Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position in a controlled manner, keeping them close to your body.

How-to Instructions:
The dumbbell bent-over raise, also known as the rear delt fly or reverse fly, is an excellent exercise for targeting the rear deltoid muscles and upper back. Using a bench for stability can help you focus on the muscle contraction and reduce the risk of injury. Here’s a detailed guide to performing the dumbbell bent-over raise:



Set Up:



Adjust the incline bench to a suitable angle, typically between 30 to 45 degrees. Stand in front of the bench holding a pair of dumbbells, with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend slightly at your knees and tighten your abs.



Starting Position:



Bend over slowly until your forehead rests on the top of the bench for support. Let your arms hang down at your sides, with your palms facing each other and your elbows slightly bent.



Executing the Raise:



Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, slowly raise your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor.

Focus on squeezing your rear deltoids (the muscles on the back of your shoulders) as you lift the weights.

Maintain control of the dumbbells throughout the movement and avoid swinging them.



End Position:



Once your arms are parallel to the floor, pause and hold for a count, squeezing your muscles to maximize the contraction.



Return to Starting Position:



Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, maintaining control and keeping a slight bend in your elbows.

How-to Instructions:
The Dumbbell Decline Bench Press is an excellent exercise for targeting the lower portion of the pectoral muscles. Here’s how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Adjust the bench to a decline angle of about 15-30 degrees. Sit on the bench with your feet securely positioned under the foot pads for stability. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).



Starting Position:



Lie back on the bench with your head lower than your hips. Position the dumbbells at chest level with your palms facing forward and elbows bent at about a 90-degree angle. Your upper arms should be parallel to the floor.



Engage Your Core:



Tighten your abdominal muscles to maintain stability and prevent arching your back during the exercise.



Press the Dumbbells:



Press the dumbbells upward in a controlled manner, straightening your arms but not locking your elbows. Ensure the dumbbells travel in a slight arc and converge slightly at the top of the movement.



Pause:



Briefly pause at the top of the movement, squeezing your chest muscles.



Lower the Dumbbells:



Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position at chest level, keeping the movement controlled.

How-to Instructions:
The Alternating Heel Touch, also known as the "heel touchers" or "side-to-side heel touches," is an effective exercise for targeting the oblique muscles and the entire core. Here’s how to perform this exercise correctly:



Starting Position:



Lie flat on your back on a mat. Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the floor, about hip-width apart. Your feet should be close enough to your body that you can comfortably reach your heels with your hands. Extend your arms down by your sides, palms facing inward. Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine.



Performing the Exercise



Lift Your Shoulders: 



Lift your head and shoulders slightly off the ground. This is your starting position.



Reach for Your Heel: 



Bend to the right, reaching your right hand towards your right heel. Focus on using your obliques to perform the movement. Exhale as you reach towards your heel.



Return to Center: 



Return to the starting position, keeping your shoulders off the ground, maintaining tension in your core.



Alternate Sides: 



Bend to the left, reaching your left hand towards your left heel. Again, focus on using your obliques to perform the movement. Exhale as you reach towards your heel.



Continue Alternating:



Continue to alternate sides in a smooth, controlled manner. Aim to reach your heels without straining your neck or lower back. Your abs and obliques should be doing the work.

How-to Instructions:
The cable front raise is an excellent exercise for targeting the front (anterior) deltoids. It also engages the upper chest and trapezius muscles. Here’s how to perform it correctly:



Attach a handle to the low pulley of a cable machine. Select an appropriate weight.



Starting Position:



Stand facing away from the cable machine. Grab the handle with one hand, allowing the cable to run between your legs. Your arm should be extended straight down in front of your thigh. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, keeping a slight bend in your knees. Engage your core and maintain a straight back.



Executing the Front Raise:



Inhale and brace your core. With a slight bend in your elbow, lift your arm straight up in front of you until it is at shoulder height or slightly above. Your palm should be facing down or slightly inward. Keep your body stationary and avoid using momentum to lift the weight. The movement should be smooth and controlled.



Returning to Starting Position:



Exhale and slowly lower the handle back to the starting position, controlling the weight as you go. Avoid letting the weight pull your arm down quickly; maintain control throughout the movement.

How-to Instructions:
The dumbbell tricep extension, when performed in a supine position, is also known as the lying tricep extension or skull crusher. Here's how you can do it:



Preparation:



Lie on a flat bench with your back pressed firmly against it. Your feet should be flat on the floor. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing inward (towards each other), and extend your arms straight up towards the ceiling. Your elbows should be slightly bent.



Execution:



Keeping your upper arms stationary, slowly lower the dumbbells towards your head by bending your elbows. Your elbows should point towards the ceiling throughout the movement. Lower the dumbbells until your forearms are parallel to the floor or until you feel a good stretch in your triceps. Keep your wrists firm and stable.

Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement, then slowly extend your elbows to bring the dumbbells back to the starting position.

How-to Instructions:
The Smith Machine Shrug is an effective exercise for targeting the trapezius muscles, particularly the upper traps. This exercise helps to build and strengthen the muscles in the upper back and neck area. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform the exercise correctly:



Setting Up:



Adjust the Smith Machine Bar: 



Set the bar to a height that is just below your hips when you are standing upright. Choose the Appropriate Weight: Load the bar with a weight that you can lift with proper form.



Position Your Body:



Stand facing the Smith Machine bar. Place your feet shoulder-width apart for stability. Stand close to the bar with your hands gripping the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using an overhand grip (palms facing down).



Lift the Bar:



Unlock the bar from the safety catches by rotating it. Stand upright with the bar hanging at arm's length in front of you.



Engage Your Core:



Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your body throughout the movement.



Shrug Your Shoulders:



Exhale as you lift your shoulders straight up towards your ears. Keep your arms straight and focus on using your trapezius muscles to lift the weight. Hold the top position for a brief moment, squeezing your traps.



Lower the Bar:



Inhale as you slowly lower your shoulders back down to the starting position. Maintain control to avoid letting the weights drop quickly.

Exercise Types:
Intermediate - Strength - Compound

Equipment:
Barbell

How-to Instructions:
The barbell bent-over row with a reverse grip (underhand grip) is a great exercise for targeting the back muscles, particularly the lower lats, as well as the biceps. Here's how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Load the barbell with the desired weight. Stand close to the barbell with your shins almost touching it.



Grip the Barbell:



Bend at your hips and knees to reach down and grip the barbell with an underhand (supinated) grip, where your palms are facing up. Your hands should be about shoulder-width apart or slightly wider.



Starting Position:



Lift the barbell by straightening your legs and then your hips to stand up straight, keeping the bar close to your body. Engage your core and maintain a slight bend in your knees. Bend at your hips to lower your torso until it is roughly parallel to the ground or slightly above, maintaining a neutral spine (do not round your back). Your arms should be fully extended, and the barbell should be hanging in front of you.



Executing the Row:



Inhale and pull the barbell towards your lower abdomen or just below your ribcage. Keep your elbows close to your body and squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement. Focus on using your back muscles rather than your arms to lift the weight.



Lowering the Barbell:



Exhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position with your arms fully extended. Keep your torso stable and avoid any jerky movements.

How-to Instructions:
The cable incline fly is an effective exercise for targeting the upper portion of the pectoral muscles. It also engages the shoulders and triceps to a lesser extent. Here's how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Adjust the pulleys on the cable machine to the lowest position. Place an incline bench between the pulleys and set the incline to about 30-45 degrees. Attach handles to the cables. Select an appropriate weight for each side.



Starting Position:



Sit on the incline bench with your feet flat on the floor. Grab the handles with an overhand grip (palms facing each other). Lie back on the bench with your arms extended above your chest, maintaining a slight bend in your elbows. Your hands should be directly over your chest.



Executing the Fly:



Inhale and brace your core. Slowly lower the handles out to your sides in a wide arc, keeping the slight bend in your elbows. Lower your arms until they are level with your chest or slightly below, feeling a stretch in your upper chest muscles. Your palms should face each other throughout the movement.



Returning to Starting Position:



Exhale and bring the handles back together in the same wide arc, focusing on squeezing your chest muscles.

Maintain the slight bend in your elbows and control the movement to keep tension on the chest muscles.

How-to Instructions:
The barbell good morning is a great exercise for targeting the posterior chain, including the lower back, glutes, and hamstrings. Here's how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Place the barbell at shoulder height on a squat rack. Position yourself under the bar so it rests comfortably on your upper back (trapezius muscles), similar to a back squat position. Grip the barbell with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Stand up to lift the bar off the rack and take a step back to clear the rack.



Starting Position:



Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Keep a slight bend in your knees throughout the movement. Engage your core and maintain a neutral spine (keep your back straight and not rounded).



Execution:



Begin the movement by hinging at your hips. Push your hips back as you lower your torso forward. Keep the barbell stable on your upper back and your back flat. Lower your torso until it is nearly parallel to the ground or as far as your flexibility allows without compromising form. Your knees should remain slightly bent but not excessively so.



Returning to Starting Position:



Reverse the movement by engaging your glutes and hamstrings to bring your torso back up to the starting position. Push your hips forward and stand upright.



Breathing:



Inhale as you lower your torso. Exhale as you return to the starting position.

How-to Instructions:
The Oblique Crunch is an effective exercise that targets the oblique muscles, which are located on the sides of your abdomen. These muscles are important for rotational movements and overall core stability. Here’s how to perform the movement correctly:



Starting Position:



Lie on your back on an exercise mat. Bend your knees resting one on top of each other.  Place your hands lightly behind your head, elbows flared out to the sides. Do not pull on your neck. Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine.



Execution:



Tighten your core muscles to prepare for the movement. Lift your right and left shoulder off the mat and laterally flex your torso raising your shoulders off the floor. Exhale as you crunch up and twist.



Top Position:



At the peak of the movement, your right and left shoulder be off the ground, and your oblique muscles fully engaged. Hold this position briefly, ensuring a strong contraction in the obliques.



Returning to Start:



Slowly lower your shoulder back to the starting position in a controlled manner. Inhale as you return to the starting position.

2.) Place each of your hands on the bar so that it is about a foot from your head and then slowly pull down the bar behind your back.



3.) Slowly pull down until the bar is at the base of your neck and squeeze your shoulder muscles. Be aware that this version of the lat pulldown can place additional stress on the shoulder joint. This is because the arms are externally rotated and abducted during the movement. A better option may be a lat pulldown to the upper chest instead.



4.) Hold this position for a count then return back up to the starting position.



Tips : 



1.) Make sure that you do not do too much weight or weight that is unmanageable as that can lead to injury or shoulder issues.

How-to Instructions:
Performing a Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL) effectively targets your hamstrings, glutes, and lower back muscles while also engaging your core for stability. Here's how to do it:



Stand with your feet about hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip (palms facing your thighs). Position the dumbbells in front of your thighs, allowing your arms to hang straight down. Engage your core muscles to stabilize your spine. Keep your chest up, shoulders back, and your back straight throughout the movement.



Keeping a slight bend in your knees, initiate the movement by hinging at your hips. Push your hips back as if you're trying to touch your glutes to the wall behind you. Lower the dumbbells towards the floor while maintaining a straight back. Keep the dumbbells close to your body throughout the movement.



Lower the dumbbells until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings. Your back should remain flat, and your torso should remain parallel to the floor throughout the movement. Be cautious not to round your back. If you feel your back starting to round, stop the descent and come back up.



Once you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, reverse the movement by driving your hips forward and squeezing your glutes. Focus on using your hamstrings and glutes to pull yourself back up to the starting position.

Keep the dumbbells close to your body as you rise.



Perform the desired number of repetitions while maintaining proper form and control over the weight.

How-to Instructions:
The cable internal rotation exercise is an excellent way to target the rotator cuff muscles, specifically the subscapularis. This exercise is crucial for shoulder stability and overall shoulder health. Here's how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Adjust the pulley on the cable machine to elbow height. Attach a single handle to the pulley. Select an appropriate weight.



Starting Position:



Stand with your side to the cable machine, so the arm you're working is nearest to the machine. Grab the handle with the hand of your working arm. Step away from the machine to create tension on the cable. Position your elbow against your side, bent at a 90-degree angle. Your forearm should be perpendicular to your torso, with your hand holding the handle in front of you.



Executing the Internal Rotation:



Inhale and brace your core. Keeping your elbow fixed against your side, rotate your arm inward, bringing your hand across your body. The movement should come from your shoulder, not your elbow or wrist. Rotate until your forearm is almost across your torso, or until you feel a good contraction in your shoulder.



Returning to Starting Position:



Exhale and slowly rotate your arm back to the starting position with control, keeping the movement smooth and controlled. Avoid letting the weight pull your arm back too quickly.

How-to Instructions:
The dumbbell incline hammer curl is an effective exercise for targeting the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles in the forearms, as well as the biceps. Performing this exercise on an incline bench increases the range of motion and helps to isolate the arm muscles, providing a more intense workout. Here's how to perform the dumbbell incline hammer curl correctly:



Start by sitting on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand, arms to your side, with your feet planted firmly in front of you. Keep your palms are facing in towards each other (i.e. hammer grip) throughout the exercise.



Flex at your elbows bringing the weights up to your shoulders, isolating the forearms and biceps, until you feel tension in the muscles.



Hold for a count then return back to the starting position and repeat for as many reps and sets as desired.

How-to Instructions:
A barbell front raise is an effective exercise for targeting the anterior deltoid muscles in your shoulders. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a barbell with both hands using an overhand grip (palms facing down). Your hands should be about shoulder-width apart on the bar.



Starting Position:



Stand straight with your arms extended downward, holding the barbell in front of your thighs. Your elbows should be slightly bent, and the barbell should be resting against your thighs.



Execution:



Engage your core muscles to stabilize your body. Lift the barbell in a controlled manner, keeping your arms straight (with a slight bend at the elbows) until it reaches shoulder height. Make sure to keep your back straight and avoid using momentum to lift the weight. Pause briefly at the top of the movement.



Lowering the Barbell:



Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position in a controlled manner. Avoid letting the barbell drop quickly.

How-to Instructions:
The cable shrug is an effective exercise for targeting the trapezius muscles, particularly the upper traps. Here’s a step-by-step guide to performing the cable shrug correctly:



Set Up the Machine:



Attach the desired handle to the cable row machine. Adjust the seat and chest pad (if available) so that you can reach the handle comfortably without overextending.



Starting Position:



Sit down on the machine with your feet securely placed on the footrests. Your knees should be slightly bent.

Grasp the handle with both hands, using an overhand or neutral grip (palms facing each other). Sit with a straight back and slight lean forward from the hips, keeping your chest up and core engaged.



Executing the Row:



Pull the handle towards your torso, leading with your elbows. Your elbows should stay close to your body. As you pull, squeeze your shoulder blades together and keep your back straight. Avoid using your lower back to pull; focus on using your upper and middle back muscles.



End Position:



Pull the handle until it reaches your torso, typically around the lower chest or upper abdomen. Hold this position for a brief moment to maximize the contraction in your back muscles.



Return to Starting Position:



Slowly extend your arms and return the handle to the starting position, maintaining control of the weight throughout the movement. Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders as you return to the start.

Exercise Types:

Equipment:
Dumbbell

How-to Instructions:
The Dumbbell Incline Bench Press with a hammer grip is a variation of the traditional incline bench press that targets the upper chest, shoulders, and triceps. Here’s a step-by-step guide to performing this exercise correctly:



Set Up:



Adjust the incline bench to an angle of around 30 to 45 degrees. Sit on the bench with your back flat against the backrest and your feet planted firmly on the ground.



Grab the Dumbbells:



Hold a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip, also known as a hammer grip. Your palms should be facing inward towards each other, and your thumbs should be pointing forward.



Starting Position:



Lie back on the bench, bringing the dumbbells up to shoulder level with your arms extended. Your elbows should be bent, and your upper arms should be perpendicular to the ground.



Executing the Press:



Press the dumbbells upward in a controlled manner, extending your arms fully. Keep your wrists straight throughout the movement. As you press the dumbbells up, focus on squeezing your chest muscles.



End Position:



At the top of the movement, the dumbbells should be directly above your shoulders, and your arms should be fully extended but not locked out.



Return to Starting Position:



Lower the dumbbells back down in a controlled manner until they are at shoulder level again. Keep your elbows slightly bent to maintain tension on the chest muscles. Avoid letting the dumbbells drop too quickly.

How-to Instructions:
The Dumbbell Decline Fly is an effective exercise for targeting the lower portion of the pectoral muscles. Here’s how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Adjust the bench to a decline angle of about 15-30 degrees. Sit on the bench with your feet securely positioned under the foot pads for stability. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).



Starting Position:



Lie back on the bench with your head lower than your hips. Extend your arms above your chest with a slight bend in your elbows. The dumbbells should be positioned directly above your shoulders, palms facing each other.



Engage Your Core:



Tighten your abdominal muscles to maintain stability and prevent arching your back during the exercise.



Lower the Dumbbells:



Lower the dumbbells in a wide arc out to the sides, keeping a slight bend in your elbows throughout the movement. Your upper arms should remain parallel to the floor. Continue lowering the dumbbells until your elbows are at or slightly below chest level. You should feel a stretch in your chest muscles.



Press the Dumbbells:



Reverse the motion, bringing the dumbbells back up in the same wide arc, keeping the slight bend in your elbows. Squeeze your chest muscles at the top of the movement, bringing the dumbbells back to the starting position.

The Jackknife Sit-Up is an effective exercise that targets the core, including the rectus abdominis and obliques, as well as engaging the hip flexors. This exercise combines elements of both a sit-up and a leg raise, providing a challenging and comprehensive core workout. Here’s how to perform the movement correctly:



Starting Position:



Lie flat on your back on an exercise mat. Extend your arms straight back behind your head, keeping them close to your ears. Extend your legs straight out in front of you, keeping them close together.



Execution:



Tighten your core muscles to prepare for the movement. Lift your arms and legs simultaneously, bringing them towards each other. Aim to touch your hands to your feet or shins at the top of the movement. Exhale as you lift your arms and legs.



Top Position:



At the peak of the movement, your body should form a "V" shape, with your arms reaching towards your feet and your legs lifted off the ground. Hold this position briefly, ensuring your core is fully engaged.

Returning to Start:



Slowly lower your arms and legs back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement.

Inhale as you lower your arms and legs.

Kettlebell

Exercise Types:
Intermediate - Strength - Compound

Equipment:
Kettlebell

How-to Instructions:
The kettlebell swing is a dynamic exercise that primarily targets the posterior chain muscles, including the glutes, hamstrings, and lower back, while also engaging the core, shoulders, and grip strength.



Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointed slightly outward. Place a kettlebell on the ground between your feet. Bend at your hips and slightly at your knees to reach down and grab the kettlebell handle with both hands. Keep your back flat, chest up, and eyes focused forward. Your arms should be fully extended, and your shoulders should be pulled back and down.



Brace your core muscles to stabilize your spine throughout the movement. Drive through your heels and hips to explosively swing the kettlebell backward between your legs. Keep your arms straight and let the kettlebell swing naturally between your legs.



As the kettlebell swings backward, forcefully thrust your hips forward to propel the kettlebell forward and upward. Imagine snapping your hips forward as if you're performing a hip thrust motion.



Allow the momentum generated by your hip thrust to swing the kettlebell upward. The kettlebell should reach roughly chest to shoulder height, depending on your strength and flexibility. At the top of the swing, the kettlebell should be weightless for a moment before it starts to descend. Keep your arms straight, and don't allow the kettlebell to pull you forward.



As the kettlebell begins to descend, hinge at your hips again and let it swing back between your legs. Keep your back flat and chest up throughout the movement. Continue the swinging motion, driving through your hips to propel the kettlebell forward and upward, and then letting it swing back down between your legs. Aim for a fluid, rhythmic motion without pausing at the top or bottom of the swing.



Exhale forcefully as you thrust your hips forward during the upward phase of the swing. Inhale as the kettlebell swings back between your legs.

How-to Instructions:
A Smith Machine Upright Row is an exercise that targets the shoulders and upper trapezius muscles. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform it correctly:



Set Up:



Position the barbell on the Smith machine at a height that is just below your thighs when you are standing upright. Add the appropriate amount of weight to the barbell.



Position Yourself:



Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing down), hands about shoulder-width apart. Stand straight with your core engaged and knees slightly bent.



Starting Position:



Unlock the bar from the Smith machine by rotating it or releasing the safety latches, depending on the machine model. Let the bar hang down in front of you with your arms fully extended but not locked out. Your shoulders should be relaxed, and the bar should be close to your thighs.



Execution:



Lift the barbell straight up towards your chin, leading with your elbows. Keep the bar close to your body. Your elbows should be higher than your forearms throughout the movement. Continue lifting until the bar reaches just below your chin or until your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Do not raise the bar too high as this can cause shoulder impingement.



Lowering the Bar:



Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position in a controlled manner. Ensure that you keep the tension in your shoulders and upper traps throughout the movement.



Breathing:



Inhale as you lift the bar up. Exhale as you lower the bar down.

The Dumbbell One-Arm Shoulder Press is an excellent exercise for building shoulder and tricep strength and stability. Here’s how to perform it correctly:



Starting Position:



Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, or sit on a bench or chair with your feet flat on the floor. Hold a dumbbell in one hand at shoulder height with your palm facing forward and your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle. Your other hand can rest on your hip or be used for balance.



Engage Your Core:

Bands

How-to Instructions:
The exercise band cross-over, often referred to as the resistance band crossover, is a great exercise for targeting the chest muscles. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform it:



Setup:



Attach the resistance bands to a sturdy anchor point at chest height. Ensure the bands are securely fastened to prevent any accidents.



Starting Position:



Stand facing away from the anchor point with a handle in each hand. Step forward to create tension in the bands. Your arms should be outstretched to the sides with a slight bend in your elbows. This is your starting position.



Body Position:



Position your feet shoulder-width apart. You can place one foot slightly forward for better balance. Engage your core muscles to keep your body stable and maintain a straight posture.



The Movement:



Exhale as you bring the handles together in front of you in a hugging motion, keeping a slight bend in your elbows. Your hands should meet in front of your chest, with palms facing each other or slightly downward. Hold the position for a brief moment, squeezing your chest muscles.



Return to Start:



Inhale as you slowly return your arms to the starting position, maintaining control and tension in the bands throughout the movement.

How-to Instructions:
The Sumo Squat is a variation of the traditional squat that targets the muscles of the lower body, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and inner thighs. Here's how to perform it:



Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, with your toes pointed slightly outward. The wider stance is characteristic of the sumo squat and helps emphasize the inner thigh muscles. Position a barbell on the floor in front of you. You can use either a standard barbell or a specialized squat bar depending on your preference.



Bend at your hips and knees to lower your torso and grasp the barbell with an overhand grip, hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Engage your core muscles to stabilize your spine and keep your chest up throughout the movement. Your back should be straight, and your shoulders should be pulled back.



Keeping your chest up and your back straight, lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back. Descend until your thighs are parallel to the ground or as low as you can comfortably go while maintaining good form. Your knees should track in line with your toes.



Push through your heels to drive yourself back up to the starting position. Keep your chest up and your back straight as you rise. Fully extend your hips and knees at the top of the movement, squeezing your glutes at the top.



Perform the desired number of repetitions while maintaining proper form and control over the weight.

How-to Instructions:
The cable flat bench fly is an excellent exercise for isolating the pectoral muscles, particularly the middle part of the chest. It also engages the shoulders and triceps. Here’s how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Place the bench in the center of the cable machine. Set the pulleys to the lowest position. Attach handles to the cables. Select an appropriate weight for each side.



Starting Position:



Lie down on the bench with your feet flat on the floor. Grab the handles with an overhand grip (palms facing inwards). Extend your arms above your chest with a slight bend in your elbows, and your hands should be directly over your chest. Your arms should remain in this slightly bent position throughout the movement.



Executing the Fly:



Inhale and brace your core. Slowly lower the handles out to your sides in a wide arc, keeping the slight bend in your elbows. Lower your arms until they are level with your chest or slightly below, feeling a stretch in your chest muscles.



Returning to Starting Position:



Exhale and reverse the motion, bringing the handles back together in the same wide arc. Focus on squeezing your chest muscles as your hands come together over your chest. Keep the movement controlled to maintain tension on the chest muscles.

How-to Instructions:
The Cable Rear Lateral Raise is a great exercise for building strong shoulders and targeting the rear deltoids. Using a cable machine offers consistent resistance, making this exercise effective for muscle development. Here’s how to perform it correctly:



Setup:



Position a bench between two cable machines. Attach handles to the low pulleys of both cable machines.

Stand between the cables, facing away from the machines. Reach back and grip the handles with the opposite hands, crossing your arms behind your back.



Starting Position:



Sit down on the bench with your feet positioned forward. Ensure your arms are crossed under your thighs, holding onto the handles. Lean forward slightly until your chest is either touching or just above your knees. This position ensures tension on the cables.



Executing the Rear Lateral Raise:



Inhale and engage your core for stability. Keeping your arms straight, slowly pull the handles outward and upward, away from each other, until they are parallel to the ground. Focus on using your shoulder muscles to perform the movement, rather than relying on momentum.



Holding the Position:



Hold the raised position for a brief moment, focusing on squeezing your shoulder blades together to maximize the contraction in your rear deltoids.



Returning to Starting Position:



Exhale and slowly lower the handles back to the starting position, controlling the movement to maintain tension on the shoulder muscles. Ensure your arms remain crossed under your thighs throughout the exercise.

Dumbbell

Exercise Types:
Intermediate - Strength - Isolation

Equipment:
Dumbbell

How-to Instructions:
The Dumbbell Lateral Raise (Prone) is an effective exercise for targeting the deltoid muscles, particularly the rear delts. Here’s a step-by-step guide to performing this exercise correctly:



Setup:



Set an incline bench to about 30-45 degrees. If you don’t have an incline bench, you can perform this exercise while lying face down on a flat bench or on the floor. Grab a pair of dumbbells with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).



Starting Position:



Lie face down on the bench with your chest supported and feet planted firmly on the floor for stability.

Allow your arms to hang down straight from your shoulders, holding the dumbbells with a slight bend in your elbows.



Execution:



Engage your core and keep your neck in a neutral position (in line with your spine). Lift the dumbbells out to the sides in a wide arc, leading with your elbows and squeezing your shoulder blades together. Raise the dumbbells until your arms are roughly parallel to the floor. Your elbows should remain slightly bent throughout the movement. Pause briefly at the top of the movement, focusing on squeezing your rear delts.



Lowering the Weights:



Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position in a controlled manner, maintaining the slight bend in your elbows. Avoid swinging the weights or using momentum to lift them.

Exercise Types:

Equipment:
Dumbbell

How-to Instructions:
The Dumbbell Cuban Press is an excellent exercise for targeting the shoulders, particularly the rotator cuff muscles, and enhancing shoulder stability and mobility. Here’s a step-by-step guide to performing the exercise correctly:



Set Up:



Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Your arms should be down by your sides with your palms facing your body (neutral grip).



Starting Position:



Raise the dumbbells by performing an upright row: lift your elbows up and to the sides until the dumbbells are at shoulder height. Your elbows should be higher than your wrists, and your upper arms should be parallel to the floor. Rotate your shoulders to bring the dumbbells into a “goalpost” position, with your elbows bent at 90 degrees and your forearms parallel to the floor. Your palms should now be facing forward.



Executing the Press:



Press the dumbbells overhead by extending your arms. Ensure your wrists, elbows, and shoulders are in alignment throughout the movement. Fully extend your arms at the top, but do not lock your elbows.



End Position:



Hold the top position for a brief moment to maximize the contraction in your shoulder muscles.



Return to Starting Position:



Lower the dumbbells back down to the “goalpost” position by bending your elbows. Rotate your shoulders to return the dumbbells to the upright row position. Lower the dumbbells back to your sides to complete one full repetition.

How-to Instructions:
Begin by lying flat on your back. Keep your back in its natural position without flattening it. This will help you do the dead bug in the most efficient and effective way.



As you brace your abs, your back should be in its natural position with a slight curve in it. Keep in mind, you should be able to fit a few fingers under the curve in your back. Next, extend your arms. Raise your feet, knees and hips.



To execute the movement, lower opposite arm and leg simultaneously. Repeat with the other arm and leg. Once you’ve finished your first arm and leg, lift and lower the other side. This ensures that you develop both sides of your abs and core evenly.

Exercise Types:
Intermediate - Strength - Compound

Equipment:

How-to Instructions:
The Barbell Ab Rollout is a highly effective exercise that targets the entire core, particularly the rectus abdominis, obliques, and lower back. It also engages the shoulders and arms. Here’s how to perform a Barbell Ab Rollout correctly:



Setup:



Load a barbell with weight plates that can roll smoothly on the floor. Kneel on an exercise mat to protect your knees.



Starting Position:



Position the barbell in front of you and grip it with an overhand (pronated) grip, hands shoulder-width apart. Your shoulders should be directly over the barbell. Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine.



Execution:



Tighten your core muscles to prepare for the movement. Slowly roll the barbell forward, extending your arms and allowing your body to move forward as well. Keep your back straight and core tight. Roll out as far as you can while maintaining a straight line from your head to your knees (or toes if performing a more advanced variation). Avoid letting your hips sag or your back arch excessively. Breathing: Inhale as you roll out.



Top Position:



At the extended position, your body should be in a straight line, parallel to the floor, with your arms fully extended.Pause briefly, ensuring your core is fully engaged and your back is not sagging.



Returning to Start:



Using your core muscles, pull the barbell back towards your knees (or feet), rolling back to the starting position.

Exhale as you return to the starting position.

How-to Instructions:
The Dumbbell Upright Row is an effective exercise for targeting the shoulders, trapezius, and upper back muscles. Here's a step-by-step guide to performing the exercise correctly:



Starting Position:



Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip (palms facing your thighs), arms fully extended down in front of you. The dumbbells should be resting against your thighs.

Keep your back straight, chest up, and engage your core muscles.



Engage Your Core:



Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your torso throughout the exercise. 



Lift the Dumbbells:



Begin the movement by lifting your elbows up and out to the sides, leading with your elbows. Keep the dumbbells close to your body as you lift them upwards. Continue lifting the dumbbells until they reach about chest level. Your elbows should be higher than your wrists, and your hands should be close to your chin.



Pause:



Briefly pause at the top of the movement, squeezing your shoulder and upper back muscles.



Lower the Dumbbells:



Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position in a controlled manner, keeping them close to your body.
